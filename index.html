                    <p>
                        Founded an SEO agency from scratch. Grew it to a multi-six figure business, worked with companies across industries, and learned what it takes to build, scale, and optimize. This taught me everything about business fundamentals—how to think strategically, solve real problems, and deliver results.

                    <p>
                        Post-exit, I moved into advising founders and leadership teams. Implemented EOS frameworks, helped companies streamline operations, and coached founders through scaling challenges. Realized that the real impact comes from helping leaders think clearly and build systems that work.

                    <p>
                        Today, I'm obsessed with how AI can solve real operational problems. Leading Ampra—building tools that help teams work smarter. Advising founders on AI strategy. Convinced that the next wave of productivity comes from automating the things that slow us down, so leaders can focus on what actually matters.
